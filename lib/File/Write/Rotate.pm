=head1 NAME

File::Write::Rotate - Write to files that archive/rotate themselves

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.19 of File::Write::Rotate (from Perl distribution File-Write-Rotate), released on 2014-08-20.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::Write::Rotate;

 my $fwr = File::Write::Rotate->new(
     dir          => '/var/log',    # required
     prefix       => 'myapp',       # required
     #suffix      => '.log',        # default is ''
     size         => 25*1024*1024,  # default is 10MB, unless period is set
     histories    => 12,            # default is 10
     #buffer_size => 100,           # default is none
 );

 # write, will write to /var/log/myapp.log, automatically rotate old log files
 # to myapp.log.1 when myapp.log reaches 25MB. will keep old log files up to
 # myapp.log.12.
 $fwr->write("This is a line\n");
 $fwr->write("This is", " another line\n");

 # compress old log files
 $fwr->compress;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module can be used to write to file, usually for logging, that can rotate
itself. File will be opened in append mode. Locking will be done to avoid
conflict when there are multiple writers. Rotation can be done by size (after a
certain size is reached), by time (daily/monthly/yearly), or both.

I first wrote this module for logging script STDERR output to files (see
L<Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate>).

=for Pod::Coverage ^(file_path|lock_file_path|DESTROY)$

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 buffer_size => INT

Get or set buffer size. If set to a value larger than 0, then when a write()
failed, instead of dying, the message will be stored in an internal buffer first
(a regular Perl array). When the number of items in the buffer exceeds this
size, then write() will die upon failure. Otherwise, every write() will try to
flush the buffer.

Can be used for example when a program runs as superuser/root then temporarily
drops privilege to a normal user. During this period, logging can fail because
the program cannot lock the lock file or write to the logging directory. Before
dropping privilege, the program can set buffer_size to some larger-than-zero
value to hold the messages emitted during dropping privilege. The next write()
as the superuser/root will succeed and flush the buffer to disk (provided there
is no other error condition, of course).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $obj = File::Write::Rotate->new(%args)

Create new object. Known arguments:

=over

=item * dir => STR (required)

Directory to put the files in.

=item * prefix => STR (required)

Name of files. The files will be named like the following:

 <prefix><period><suffix><rotate_suffix>

C<< <period> >> will only be given if the C<period> argument is set. If
C<period> is set to C<yearly>, C<< <period> >> will be C<YYYY> (4-digit year).
If C<period> is C<monthly>, C<< <period> >> will be C<YYYY-MM> (4-digit year and
2-digit month). If C<period> is C<daily>, C<< <period> >> will be C<YYYY-MM-DD>
(4-digit year, 2-digit month, and 2-digit day).

C<< <rotate_suffix> >> is either empty string for current file; or C<.1>, C<.2>
and so on for rotated files. C<.1> is the most recent rotated file, C<.2> is the
next most recent, and so on.

An example, with C<prefix> set to C<myapp>:

 myapp         # current file
 myapp.1       # most recently rotated
 myapp.2       # the next most recently rotated

With C<prefix> set to C<myapp>, C<period> set to C<monthly>, C<suffix> set to
C<.log>:

 myapp.2012-12.log     # file name for december 2012
 myapp.2013-01.log     # file name for january 2013

Like previous, but additionally with C<size> also set (which will also rotate
each period file if it exceeds specified size):

 myapp.2012-12.log     # file(s) for december 2012
 myapp.2012-12.log.1
 myapp.2012-12.log.2
 myapp.2013-01.log     # file(s) for january 2013

All times will use local time, so you probably want to set C<TZ> environment
variable or equivalent methods to set time zone.

=item * suffix => STR (default: '')

Suffix to give to file names, usually file extension like C<.log>. See C<prefix>
for more details.

If you use a yearly period, setting suffix is advised to avoid ambiguity with
rotate suffix (for example, is C<myapp.2012> the current file for year 2012 or
file with C<2012> rotate suffix?)

=item * size => INT (default: 10*1024*1024)

Maximum file size, in bytes, before rotation is triggered. The default is 10MB
(10*1024*1024) I<if> C<period> is not set. If C<period> is set, no default for
C<size> is provided, which means files will not be rotated for size (only for
period).

=item * period => STR

Can be set to either C<daily>, C<monthly>, or C<yearly>. If set, will
automatically rotate after period change. See C<prefix> for more details.

=item * histories => INT (default: 10)

Number of rotated files to keep. After the number of files exceeds this, the
oldest one will be deleted. 0 means not to keep any history, 1 means to only
keep C<.1> file, and so on.

=item * buffer_size => INT (default: 0)

Set initial value of buffer. See the C<buffer_size> attribute for more
information.

=back

=head2 $fwr->write(@args)

Write to file. Will automatically rotate file if period changes or file size
exceeds specified limit. When rotating, will only keep a specified number of
histories and delete the older ones. Uses locking, so multiple writers do not
clobber one another. Lock file is named C<< <prefix> >>C<.lck>. Will wait for up
to 1 minute to acquire lock, will die if failed to acquire lock.

Does not append newline so you'll have to do it yourself.

=head2 $fwr->compress

Compress old rotated files. Currently uses L<IO::Compress::Gzip> to do the
compression. Extension given to compressed file is C<.gz>.

Will not lock writers, but will create C<< <prefix> >>C<-compress.pid> PID file
to prevent multiple compression processes running and to signal the writers to
postpone rotation.

After compression is finished, will remove the PID file, so rotation can be done
again on the next C<write()> if necessary.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 Why use autorotating log?

Mainly convenience and low maintenance. You no longer need a separate rotator
like the Unix B<logrotate> utility (which when accidentally disabled or
misconfigured will cause your logs to stop being rotated and grow indefinitely).

=head2 What is the downside of using FWR (and LDFR)?

Mainly performance overhead, as every write() involves locking to make it safe
to use with multiple processes. Tested on my Core i5 3.1 GHz desktop, writing
log lines in the size of ~ 200 bytes, raw writing to disk (SSD) has the speed of
around 3.4mil/s, while using FWR it comes down to around 19.5k/s.

However, this is not something you'll notice or need to worry about unless
you're logging near that speed.

=head1 TODO

Perhaps an option to disable locking.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Log::Dispatch::FileRotate>, which inspires this module. Differences between
File::Write::Rotate (FWR) and Log::Dispatch::FileRotate (LDFR) are as follows:

=over

=item * FWR is not part of the L<Log::Dispatch> family.

This makes FWR more general to use.

For using together with Log::Dispatch/Log4perl, I have also written
L<Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate> which is a direct (although not a perfect
drop-in) replacement for Log::Dispatch::FileRotate.

=item * Secondly, FWR does not use L<Date::Manip>.

Date::Manip is relatively large (loading Date::Manip 6.37 equals to loading 34
files and ~ 22k lines; while FWR itself is only < 1k lines!)

As a consequence of this, FWR does not support DatePattern; instead, FWR
replaces it with a simple daily/monthly/yearly period.

=item * And lastly, FWR supports compressing and rotating compressed old files.

Using separate processes like the Unix B<logrotate> utility means having to deal
with yet another race condition. FWR takes care of that for you (see the
compress() method). You also have the option to do log compression in the same
script/process if you want, which is convenient.

=back

There is no significant overhead difference between FWR and LDFR (FWR is
slightly faster than LDFR on my testing).

L<Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate> and Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate, which use
this module.
