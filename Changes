Revision history for File-Write-Rotate

0.09    2012-12-28 (SHARYANTO)

        Make rotate pass under taint-mode.


0.08    2012-12-28 (SHARYANTO)

        [BUG FIXES]

        - Can now rotate on the first write() instead of on the second and
          subsequent.


0.07    2012-12-27 (SHARYANTO)

        Avoid using Log::Any, because we are used as backend for
        Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate (thus, a loop).


0.06    2012-12-27 (SHARYANTO)

        Set autoflush (to pass Log-Any-App09 tests).


0.05    2012-12-26 (SHARYANTO)

        No functional changes. Mention 'period' argument in POD.


0.04    2012-12-26 (SHARYANTO)

        - A small fix in DESTROY().


0.03    2012-12-25 (SHARYANTO)

        No functional changes. Extract flocking routines to
        SHARYANTO::File::Flock.


0.02    2012-12-22 (SHARYANTO)

        No functional changes. Additions/corrections for POD.
